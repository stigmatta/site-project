                        Maomi, in its purest essence, is the desire for self-improvement and to expand one’s capabilities beyond all limitations.

                    <p>
                        Here at Maomi, we believe that it’s our mission to not only continuously improve our brand and beverages and the lives of our customers through providing only the most delicious, high-quality flavors but also to inspire the community to dream big and live fearlessly.

                            Founded in Queens, NY on April 30, 2010, we’re America’s largest bubble tea brand with over 350+ locations across the U.S. As one of the OGs of bubble tea, we maintain uncompromisingly high standards. Let’s be real. Making tea that looks good isn’t the hard part. The actual challenge is making tea that tastes good and presenting it in an innovative way. Made with the art of ‘3T’ Maomi, every cup of tea is freshly brewed at the perfect temperature using premium tea leaves. The beverages we bring to the table are strong inside-out — perfect for your taste buds and your Instagram stories.

                        <div>
                            <span> “Unrivaled quality, utmost attention to detail and unquestionable authenticity, that is the Maomi culture.”</span>

                    <p>
                        Oh yeah, what’s our dream? To elevate the world of made-to-order beverages with a ‘Fresh – Innovative – Fearless’ approach and be present wherever you are (not in a Joe Goldberg type of way).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On April 30, 2018 (our 8th birthday), we founded <a href = "https://www.nationaldaycalendar.com/national-day/national-bubble-tea-day-april-30" style="color: rgb(196, 59, 59);">National Bubble Tea Day</a> to honor the growing community of people who live and breathe bubble tea while celebrating the beverage that has made our lives bubblier.

                    </div>
                        <p>
                            We expected the path ahead to be filled with challenges. It wasn’t easy maintaining and expanding a bubble tea business during the earlier days, let alone now when the industry has become incredibly competitive with bubble tea shops on almost every block.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nevertheless, even when things got difficult — limited space, cash flow shortages, troublesome landlords — giving up was never an option for us. To overcome these challenges, we reminded ourselves of our mission, pushed to persevere rather than become discouraged by fear of failure, and surrounded ourselves with equally fearless individuals who shared similar passions, values, and beliefs. If anyone felt defeated, we would be there to motivate them.
                        </p>

                                Moral of the story: anyone can become a Kung Fu Master as long as they remain fearlessly dedicated in the face of challenges. With the Kung Fu spirit (and the principles that it involves), you can achieve mastery in your careers, hobbies, personal lives, and more. Keep this in mind: without the struggles, there wouldn’t be any progress.

                            Unsurprisingly, all our franchisees, baristas, and customers embody our ‘Fearless’ brand motto. Join us in challenging the beverage industry and challenging ourselves to be the best.

                                Consistency in flavor, quality, and in-store experience across all Kung Fu Tea locations is extremely important to us. We also ensure that all our stores, both big and small, are fun, cozy, and welcoming. Grab a drink before class. Film a TikTok dance. Host a happy hour with coworkers. Treat your kids to drinks on a beautiful Sunday.
